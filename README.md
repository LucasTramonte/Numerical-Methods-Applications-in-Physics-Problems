# physics-problems-with-numerical-methods
The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate how we can solve various physical problems using numerical methods

Simpler physics problems, such as questions 1 and 2, can be solved analytically, without the need for computational methods. However, questions 3, 4 and 5 require numerical methods to be solved.

- **Question 1 - Cylinders**
- **Question 2 - Conical pendulum**
- **Question 3 - Semi-spherical container**
- **Question 4. - Calculation of the Electric Field of a Uniformly Charged Ring**
- **Question 5. Calculation of the Electric Field of a Uniformly Charged Ring - Any Position**

The statements and answers in detail, with the mathematical formulation, can be found in Assets.
